Customer Analysis and Clustering Project
Project Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for a customer analysis project, including EDA, lookalike modeling, and clustering. The tasks aim to provide insights into customer behavior and segmentation using Python-based data science techniques.

Tasks and Deliverables
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Analyze customer and transaction data to uncover patterns and trends.
Key Steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).
Visualizing key metrics like transaction frequency, customer regions, and product preferences.
Generating insights using plots (e.g., bar charts, histograms).
Deliverables:
EDA Report: FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf
Code: FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb


Task 2: Lookalike Modeling
Objective: Build a model to recommend the top 3 similar customers for each customer based on their profile and transaction data.
Key Steps:
Merge and preprocess Customers.csv and Transactions.csv.
Create feature embeddings for customers.
Calculate cosine similarity scores between customer profiles.
Recommend top 3 similar customers with scores.
Deliverables:
Lookalike CSV: FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv
Code: FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb


Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Objective: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
Key Steps:
Use profile and transaction data as features.
Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans).
Evaluate clusters using metrics (e.g., DB Index, Silhouette Score).
Visualize clusters using scatter and pair plots.
Deliverables:
Clustering Report: FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf
Code: FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb
Evaluation Criteria

Task 1: Quality of insights and data visualizations.
Task 2:
Model accuracy and recommendation logic.
Quality of similarity scores and relevance of recommendations.
Task 3:
Clustering logic and metrics (e.g., DB Index).
Quality of cluster visualizations.
